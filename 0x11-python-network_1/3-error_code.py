'''
    Python script that takes in a URL,
    sends a request to the URL and displays
    the body of the response (decoded in utf-8).

    You have to manage urllib.error.HTTPError exceptions and print:
    Error code: followed by the HTTP status code

    You must use the packages urllib and sys
    You are not allowed to import other packages than urllib and sys
    You donâ€™t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
    You must use the with statement
'''
from urllib.request import Request, urlopen
from urllib.error import HTTPError
from sys import argv


if __name__ == "__main__":
    req = Request(argv[1])
    try:
        with urlopen(req) as response:
            html = response.read()
            print(html.decode('utf-8'))
    except HTTPError as error:
        print('Error code: {}'.format(error.code))
